# Machine-Learning---Data-Analysis-
models which are used for analysis of data and finding risk factor on basis of particular data sets

This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to conduct comprehensive Data Analysis and uncover critical insights. It focuses on identifying patterns, evaluating risk factors, and predicting potential outcomes using advanced algorithms. Key tasks include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, correlations, and anomalies in the data through statistical analysis and visualizations.
Risk Analysis: Quantifying and analyzing potential risks or uncertainties associated with key variables, providing actionable insights for decision-making.
Predictive Modeling: Employing machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and KNN to forecast outcomes based on input features.
Feature Engineering: Improving model performance by transforming, scaling, and encoding features.
This project aims to provide a robust framework for tackling business challenges, optimizing decision-making processes, and supporting risk mitigation strategies through intelligent data-driven approaches.
